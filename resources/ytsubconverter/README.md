this tool is a command-line,  
or a UI.

it can convert subtitles, mostly .srv3 to .ass, 
while preserving the styles.

ffmpeg can't handle some of YouTube's srv3 or newer vtt,  
but with this you can convert them to .ass which ffmpeg can convert to srt or sub,  
which will allow you to embed (manually) the subtitles.


a C# application, unmodified.
